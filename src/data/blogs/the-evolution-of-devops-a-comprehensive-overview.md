    **Background and Motivation**


    The original version of our staging system can be traced back to the Martin Garrix project where we had a need for ensuring that the preview environment for the client was behind a secure login to ensure the project would not leak before the release date. We threw together a quick prototype that we continuously used during the project.


    When we extended its use to another client project, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The prototype succeeded in addressing security concerns and the gaps in our deployment process became evident. It wasn’t just a tool; it was a solution that filled a significant gap in our workflow.


    Recognizing its potential, we made the decision to evolve this prototype into a full-fledged system. Our aim? To make it a cornerstone of our deployment process, ensuring security, efficiency and consistency in every project we undertook.
